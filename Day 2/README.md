Day 2: Boolean Statement Challenge 

Challenge: Eligibility Checker
Problem:
You are tasked with building a simple eligibility checker for a bank loan. The eligibility criteria are as follows:

The applicant must be at least 21 years old.
The applicant must have a monthly income of at least $2000.
The applicant must have been employed for at least 2 years.
You will write a program that checks whether an applicant is eligible for the loan, using Boolean statements to evaluate the conditions.

Instructions:
Create a class Applicant with the following properties:

Name (string)
Age (int)
MonthlyIncome (double)
YearsEmployed (int)
Write a method called IsEligibleForLoan(Applicant applicant) that returns true if all the eligibility criteria are met, otherwise, return false.

In the Main method, create several applicants with different ages, incomes, and employment durations, and print whether they are eligible for the loan or not.
