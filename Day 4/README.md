# Day 4: Array Manipulation and Statistics

Problem:
You are tasked with managing an array of integers and performing various operations on it. Your task is to demonstrate your ability to work with array properties and methods by manipulating the array, gathering statistics, and displaying relevant information.

Instructions:
Initialize an array of integers with at least 10 elements.

Implement the following functionality using array properties and methods:

Find the maximum value in the array.
Find the minimum value in the array.
Calculate the sum of all elements in the array.
Calculate the average of the array values.
Sort the array in ascending order.
Sort the array in descending order.
Reverse the array (without sorting).
Search for a specific element in the array and return its index.
Resize the array to add more elements.
Clear all elements in the array.
Additional Details:

Use methods like Array.Sort(), Array.Reverse(), Array.Resize(), Array.Clear(), and access array properties such as Length.
Create a menu where the user can choose which operation to perform on the array.
Display relevant information (such as the maximum value, sorted array, etc.) after each operation.
